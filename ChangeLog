	* Version 1.4 released.

	* Audio sources: The D-Bus interfaces for requesting audio path
	  switching now require a dictionary parameter. This dictionary
	  contains arbitrary data which is passed to the audio source and
	  audio player involved in the audio path switch.

	  So far, our only use case for this change is passing standby
	  information when switching to inactive state as required for Roon
	  certification.

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* Audio path synchronization: The appliance's audio system state can
	  be set via D-Bus now. Audio source switching only completes if the
	  appliance is known (or assumed) to be able to output sound. If not,
	  then completion of audio path activation is deferred until it is.

	  This feature enables proper synchronization of the Streaming Board
	  with the audio hardware inside (or around) the appliance.

	* Misc: Support concurrent requests of same audio source.
